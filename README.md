Swiggy clone that i made while learning reactjs so code quality is very poor and looks so messy. On the other hand the its is laden with a lot of features like code splitting,custom hooks,usecontext api to manage data,shimmer, config driven UI, conditional rendering or on demand loading,react-ruoter for router ,realtime Swiggy API to fetch data for my location and redux for maintaining the state of the app.

Tech Stack:

Vite : Bundler use to bootstrap the react SPA.

React-Router: routing implemented using react-router library 

redux/toolkit: implemented state management of the App

babel: used a transpiler

tailwind CSS : to style the app 

jest : testing library to write unit tests
